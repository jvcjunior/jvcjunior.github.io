In the last days I've been studying javascript. Watching Kyle's Simpson advanced javascript course in pluralsight, I started to go deep into 
the differences between compiled languages and interpreted languages. I found some great stuff and would like to share with you. 

### Search for the truth
Let me explain my journey to find the differences between compiled languages and interpreted languages. It started when I was 
watching Kyle's course. In the course he spent a lot of time explaining how javascript engine works and the process of compilation 
of the language. When he said compilation I thought: 'Compilation? Is Javascript Compiled?' I was curious about that statement. 

Well, I decided to dig deep into this topic to find some answers. The first question I started to find an answer was: 

"Is javascript Compiled or Interpreted?". 

After some reading I realized that I would have to find the anwser to another question if I wanted to fully understand the answer to the 
first question I had. And this second question was: 

'What is the difference between Compiled 'languages' and Interpreted 'languages'?'.

### Big Question: Compiled 'languages' x Interpreted 'languages'
I don't know if you realized that I wrote languages in simple quotes. There's a reason for that.



### Conclusion
