Hey guys, I am going to start writing some posts in english and this will be the first one. I hope you can understand what I am trying to say and this post help you to understand this concept that for me was hard to understand but now I see it isn't so hard. 

### Clarification

Have you ever seen matrix movie? It is an awesome movie, isn't it? Do you remember when Neo sees the Matrix for the first time? Understanding closures is like that. Something like: "closures are already occurring all over my code, I can finally see them now". Great javascript libraries and frameworks like JQuery implements this concept in its core code.
