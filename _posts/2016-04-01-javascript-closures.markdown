Hey guys, I am going to start writing some posts in english and this is going to be the first one. I hope you can understand what I am trying to say and this post help you to understand this concept that for me was hard to understand but now I see it isn't so hard. 

### Clarification

The enlightenment moment should be: oh, closures are already occurring all over my code, I can finally see them now. Understanding closures is like when Neo sees the Matrix for the first time.
